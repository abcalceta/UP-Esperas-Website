Maybe you've heard about us. Maybe you've read about Esperanto sometime and asked yourself: "What's that?"

We invite you to join us tomorrow, June 23 (Saturday) in the weekend sessions of the "What is Esperanto?": An Introductory Orientation and Basic Language Course, and know more about Esperanto, the fastest-growing international auxiliary language project!

There will be three sessions:
10:00am-12:00pm, 1:00-3:00pm, 4:00pm-6:00pm

Venue: Bo's Coffee, 99 Maginhawa St., Quezon City

This is free and open to all interested.

In order to receive more updates on discussions and start learning the language with us, we invite you to join UP Esperas! Sign up today at http://bit.ly/UPEsperasSignUp.

We are sorry for the short notice. See you tomorrow!
