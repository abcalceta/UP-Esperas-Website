Do you have a writer friend that keeps saying they'll make a language but doesn't really push through with it?

ARE YOU THAT FRIEND?

Then, what are you waiting for, writers and worldbuilders? Join us at CAL 201 this Thursday, 17 October, 2019, 1:30PM-5:00PM and let's make a language together for your world(ly) needs!

UP Esperanto-Societo presents "Writers and Worldbuilders! How to Make a Language ver2", an interactive and Alternative Classroom Learning Experience (ACLE).

PSsst. This ACLE is free and open to the public, so bring your friends along! Snacks will also be served while finally pushing through making a language.
