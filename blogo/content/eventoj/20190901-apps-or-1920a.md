ĉielen (adv.) - skyward

A very succinct word in Esperanto. Encompassing the sky, the motion itself, and the direction towards it, moving skyward can be frightening. However, the bird can do this gracefully and effortlessly. Just like the wings of a bird, Esperanto can help you fly skyward to view new sights, experience unique adventures, and discover new frontiers across the globe.

We are set on helping you aim skyward through the international language Esperanto. We are now opening our windows and wings for new members of our organization. Interested? Be part of us by filling-up this form!

Don't forget to attend our New Members' Orientation on September 5 (Thu), 5:30-7:30 PM. The tentative venue is at PH 228A.

Soar to new heights, fly across borders, and promote peace and mutual understanding with Esperanto and UP Esperas!
