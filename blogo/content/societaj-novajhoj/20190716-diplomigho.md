UP Esperanto-Societo proudly extends its most sincere congratulations to the graduates of 2019 and its very first batch of alumni!

To our own alumni, this small but growing organization of Esperanto advocates, learners and enthusiasts alike will continue what you have started. We cannot wait to see where this trail of sunflowers will lead you, but UP Esperas will always be here to welcome you back home.

Padayon! Gratulon pro via diplomiƒùo!
