The delegates of UP Esperanto-Societo attended the 37th Joint Seminar of Asian Esperanto Youth held in Da Nang, Vietnam between April 29 and May 3.

The seminar consisted of an acquaintance night, lectures about local Esperanto movements across Asia, and the issue of pollution in the marine environment and sustainable consumption. There were also several competitions to strengthen friendship and relationships among people from different countries, and a set of excursions to get to know with these history and culture of Vietnam. Participants talked during the five days using the international language Esperanto.

UP Esperas thank the organizers of the seminar for a very informative, hospitable, and amusing seminar! We hope to attend more Esperanto congresses soon!
