Why are people driven to learn Esperanto, Dothraki, Klingon, and the like? How does one even begin the creation of these constructed languages? And what are constructed languages in the first place?

On the 21st of February 2019, UP Esperanto-Societo (UP Esperas) kicked off its second ACLE on "How To Make A Language: A Primer On Constructed Languages," taking its participants on an expedition into the fascinating world of conlangs.

Albert Stalin Garrido engaged us in what constructed languages are and why people learn and create them. Then we ventured into the magical realm of Encantadia with Carl Dizon, together with some words from Noel Layon Flores, the creator of Enchan and several other scripts used in the kingdom. China Pagulayan acquainted us with some conlangs, from the 21st century revival of SolReSol, to the Gallifreyan of the Timelords. And to cap the event, Ace Baria took us on a step-by-step construction of our own languages, culminating into a showcase of lexical creations.

We would like to convey our immense gratitude to Mr. Noel Layon Flores for his time and input.

Thank you to everyone who attended our ACLE, and we hope to see you in UP Esperas' future events.

Dankon!
