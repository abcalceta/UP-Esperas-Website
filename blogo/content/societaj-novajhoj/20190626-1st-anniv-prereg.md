Saluton!

We would like to announce that the preregistration form for those who intend to participate in the Esperanto Day & UP Esperas 1st Anniversary Celebration is now available.

Our event is open to all individuals who are part of the local Esperanto community in the Philippines and those who are willing to learn more about Esperanto and UP Esperas. The entrance fees, which are inclusive of food, venue costs, and materials, are PhP 150 for members of UP Esperas and PhP 160 for non-members.

We encourage everyone to preregister so that we may anticipate the number of attendees and prepare accordingly. We gladly welcome everyone to celebrate with us as we commemorate our first year since our organization was founded in 2018.

Dankon!
