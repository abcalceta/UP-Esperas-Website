How has a language you speak given you a wider, clearer perspective of the world? By travelling abroad, getting new friends online, or simply learning to appreciate culture. Or better yet -- do you a know a language that can make you look at and get to greater distances?

Come and join UP Esperanto-Societo in its very first Alternative Classroom Learning Experience (ACLE), as we help you open your window to a wider understanding of the world and contact with people from various countries -- with the help of the international language Esperanto!

Interesting basic language lessons and unique interactive activities are also waiting for you! Free food and drinks!

This event is free and open to the public (including non-UP). For inquiries, please contact Carl at 09082154940.
