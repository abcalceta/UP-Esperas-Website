                We are glad to inform everyone that through the initiative of some dedicated members of
                the Esperanto language community in the Philippines, preparations for the very first
                Philippine Esperanto Youth Congress to be held in 2020 have started.
            </p>
            <p>
                This historic congress shall mark the culmination of the seven years of effort of
                Esperanto advocates in the country and the forward step towards the further growth
                and integration of the national Esperanto community, and shall provide speakers,
                learners, and advocates coming from different parts of the country the opportunity
                to interact, learn, and work together in a series of social and educational activities.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="col s12">
            However, since there are only a few people within the Organizing Committee, they can't
            do all the preparations on their own. So, we need you, volunteers, to be our partners
            to carry out different parts and aspects of preparation for this historical event.
