    <p>
        Philippine Esperanto Youth (FEJ), in cooperation with the Esperanto Society of the University of the Philippines (UP Esperanto-Societo), will hold the first-ever <em>Philippine Esperanto Youth Congress (PEYC)</em> in Quezon City, Metro Manila on April 23-26, 2020.
    </p>
    <p>
        This historic congress shall mark the culmination of six years of effort of Esperanto advocates in the country and the step towards further growth and integration of the national Esperanto community, and as such, it will serve a unique role of convening young speakers, learners, and advocates of the international language Esperanto across the country for the first time since the present-day Esperanto community was established in 2013.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the theme "The Esperanto Movement: Fresh Beginnings in a Multicultural Philippines," the four-day Congress will provide young Filipinos coming from different parts of the country the opportunity to interact, learn, and work together in a series of social and educational activities. There will be sessions dedicated to strategic discussions on matters important to the Philippine Esperanto movement, as well as interactive activities such as workshops, including a crash course for beginners in Esperanto, fun social and outdoor activities, cultural exchange activities, and a tour to some historical or natural parts around the capital.
