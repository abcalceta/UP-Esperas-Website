        The official emblem of the 1st Philippine Esperanto Youth Congress uses a font-based design which principally consists of the initials of its official name in Esperanto, i.e. <em>Filipina Junulara Kongreso</em> (lit. "Philippine Youth Congress"), abbreviated as "FJK".

    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
        The first letter, F, colored in <span class="theme-green-text">green</span> (Esperanto's customary color), consists of a design portraying indigenous patterns heralded by various national minority groups in the country, in support of the International Year of Indigenous Languages (IYIL) celebrated this 2019 upon the initiative by the United Nations (UN) and closely supported by the international Esperanto movement.

        The variety in colors of the letters represent multiculturalism and diversity, values which the Philippines take pride in as part of its core national identity. The emblem also rightly complements the official theme of the Congress: <b>The Esperanto Movement: Fresh Beginnings in a Multicultural Philippines</b>, which highlights the importance of multiculturalism and its relationship to the advocacies and values of the Esperanto movement. As a focus of its activities, the Congress also aims to provide various avenues to promote the understanding and appreciation of cultural diversity in the Philippines.

        This emblem was designed by <b>Leo Gregory A. Fordan</b>, member of the Congress Volunteer Staff.
