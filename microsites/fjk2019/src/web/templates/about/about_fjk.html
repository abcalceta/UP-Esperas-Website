    <h3>Why Hold a Congress?</h3>
    <p>
        The Congress, a major milestone for the local Esperanto movement, is actually
        highly anticipated in the international Esperanto community. Already long overdue,
        it is expected to draw the attendance of speakers and advocates of the language
        from other countries, most of which aim to tour the country and get to know with
        members of the local Esperanto community, providing a truly international experience
        for Filipinos without leaving the country.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Congress will also be the most appropriate opportunity to consolidate the
        Esperanto movement in the Philippines and bring together local speakers and advocates
        from all regions of the country. This will be avenues for everyone, coming from diverse
        fields of interests and expertise, to freely socialize and exchange information and
        opinions on a wide range of topics. Most important, lasting initiatives for the local
        Esperanto movement may also be born here.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, if successfully organized, the Congress shall be an impetus towards a
        wider public and institutional knowledge and recognition of Esperanto as a living
        language for egalitarian interethnic communication, eventually drawing the interest
        of many people from different walks of life to learn the language and be part of the
        national Esperanto community.
