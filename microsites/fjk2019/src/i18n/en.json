                "The <em>Philippine Esperanto Youth</em> (FEJ), in cooperation with the <em>Esperanto Society of the University of the Philippines</em> (UP Esperanto-Societo/UP Esperas) will be organizing the first ever <b>Philippine Esperanto Youth Conference</b> (PEYC), which will take place in 2020 in Manila, Philippines.",
                "This historic congress shall mark the culmination of the seven years of effort of Esperanto advocates in the country and the forward step towards the further growth and integration of the national Esperanto community, and shall provide speakers, learners, and advocates coming from different parts of the country the opportunity to interact, learn, and work together in a series of social and educational activities.",
                "With the theme <em>The Esperanto Movement: fresh start in a multicultural Philippines</em>, the congress will serve a unique and grand role in convening the Esperanto youth for the first time across the country. Aside from sessions on the Philippine Esperanto movement, there will also be cultural talks, an Esperanto crash course, fun social activities, and an excursion to some historical or natural parts around Manila."
