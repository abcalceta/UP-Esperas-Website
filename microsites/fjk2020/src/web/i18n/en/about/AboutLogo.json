            "par01": "The variety in colors of the letters represent multiculturalism and diversity, values which the Philippines take pride in as part of its core national identity. The emblem also rightly complements the official theme of the Congress: <b>The Esperanto Movement: Fresh Beginnings in a Multicultural Philippines</b>, which highlights the importance of multiculturalism and its relationship to the advocacies and values of the Esperanto movement. As a focus of its activities, the Congress also aims to provide various avenues to promote the understanding and appreciation of cultural diversity in the Philippines.",
