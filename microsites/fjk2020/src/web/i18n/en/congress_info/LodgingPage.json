Despite having a total size of 4.93 sq. km., making it one of the biggest campuses in the country, most of its facilties are easily accessible by foot or by taking jeepneys (local public transportation) which ply along its thoroughfares.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the university is located in Quezon City, which is in the heart of Metropolitan Manila, there are numerous hotels and other accommodation that can be found within the city. However, the university offers hostels and dormitories whose prices are considerably lower than those outside the campus, besides being in a relatively peaceful and safe environment beyond the bustling city. It will also provide the participants easier access to the program and spare time from having to commute, especially because most major roads experience heavy traffic during the rush hour.\n</p>\n"
